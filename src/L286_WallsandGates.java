/**
 You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

 -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
 0 - A gate.
 INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF
 as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
 Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.
 For example, given the 2D grid:

 INF  -1  0  INF
 INF INF INF  -1
 INF  -1 INF  -1
 0  -1 INF INF
 After running your function, the 2D grid should be:

 3  -1   0   1
 2   2   1  -1
 1  -1   2  -1
 0  -1   3   4
