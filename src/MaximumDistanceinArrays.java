    we can keep on traversing over the arrays in the list and keep a track of the maximum distance found so far.
    To do so, we keep a track of the element with minimum value and the one with maximum value found so far.
    For every new array, a considered, we find the distance a[n-1]-min and max_valâˆ’a[0]
    to compete with the maximum distance found so far.
    Here, n refers to the number of elements in the current array, a.
    Further, we need to note that the points min_val and max_val
    both need not always contribute to the maximum distance found till now.
    But, such points could help in maximizing the distance in the future.
    Thus, max_val and min_val contribute to the global maximum and minimum values found till now,
    irrespective of the points considered for the contribution in the maximum distance found till now.
